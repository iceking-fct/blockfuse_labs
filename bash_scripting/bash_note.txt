# 🐧 Linux Shell Script Task – User & Group Permissions

This project contains a beginner-friendly shell script to automate the creation of users, groups, directories, and permission management in a Linux environment.

---

## 📋 Task Overview

The shell script performs the following actions:

1. Create a group `cohort-3-web2` and add users `ali` and `bob` to it.
2. Create a folder `~/documents/web2/cohort3`.
3. Change the group ownership of that folder to `cohort-3-web2`.
4. Ensure that both `ali` and `bob` have **read and write** access to that folder.
5. Create another group `cohort-2` and a user `ola`.
6. Ensure `ola` **does NOT have access** to `~/documents/web2/cohort3`.

---

## 📜 Shell Script (`setup_groups.sh`)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Step 1: Create group
sudo groupadd cohort-3-web2

# Step 2: Create users ali and bob
sudo useradd -m ali
sudo useradd -m bob

# Step 3: Add users to the group
sudo usermod -aG cohort-3-web2 ali
sudo usermod -aG cohort-3-web2 bob

# Step 4: Create target directory
mkdir -p ~/documents/web2/cohort3

# Step 5: Change group ownership
sudo chgrp -R cohort-3-web2 ~/documents/web2/cohort3

# Step 6: Set group read & write permissions
sudo chmod -R 770 ~/documents/web2/cohort3

# Step 7: Create second group and user
sudo groupadd cohort-2
sudo useradd -m ola
````

## 👀 How to View Users & Groups

### ✅ List All Users

```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```

### ✅ Check If a Specific User Exists

```bash
id ali
id bob
id ola
```

### ✅ List All Groups

```bash
cat /etc/group
```

### ✅ See a User's Groups

```bash
groups ali
groups bob
groups ola
```

## 🔒 Access Control Check

* The directory `~/documents/web2/cohort3` is set to permission `770`, which means:

  * Owner: full access
  * Group (`cohort-3-web2`): full access
  * Others (like `ola`): **no access**

To test:

```bash
sudo su - ola
cd ~/documents/web2/cohort3
# ➜ You should get: "Permission denied"
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Script

1. Save the script in a file named `setup_groups.sh`
2. Make it executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_groups.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./setup_groups.sh
   ```

---

## 📌 Notes

* Make sure you have `sudo` privileges to execute user and group commands.
* This script is tested on Ubuntu-based distributions.
